The code can be run on the Google Colaboratory platform, where the notebook is already configured to import the necessary packages.
The only necessary file, “lemmatizer.py”, must be loaded locally into the notebook environment for the code to work properly; the datasets are directly imported from their GitHub repository. 
To optimize runtime performance, especially for the text summarization task, ensure that the GPU is enabled.
